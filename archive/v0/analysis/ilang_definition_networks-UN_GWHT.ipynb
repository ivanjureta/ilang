       "' Paragraph 24 of the Operational Guidelines requires that a cultural property nominated for inclusion in the World Heritage List be considered for inclusion only if it meets one or more of the cultural heritage criteria and the test of authenticity. Paragraph 24 (b) (i) of the Operational Guidelines as reproduced below refers to the test of authenticity. 24. ... (b) (i) meet the test of authenticity in design, material, workmanship or setting and in the case of cultural landscapes their distinctive character and components (the Committee stressed the reconstruction is only acceptable if it is carried out on the basis of complete and detailed documentation on the original and to no extent on conjecture) (UNESCO February 1996: 7). The text concerning groups of urban buildings included in the Operational Guidelines also refers to the need to meet the test of authenticity (UNESCO February 1996: 8, Paragraph 27). Paragraphs 57 and 58 of the Operational Guidelines state that cultural properties nominated for inclusion in the World Heritage List should satisfy the conditions of authenticity and that the determination as to whether these conditions are met will be carried out by ICOMOS (UNESCO February 1996: 18). Paragraph 64 (e) of the Operational Guidelines states that \"indications as to the authenticity of the property\" should be included in the completed nomination form under the heading of \"Justification for inclusion in the World Heritage List\" (UNESCO February 1996: 20). Paragraphs 64 (f) (iv) and 78 of the Operational Guidelines refer to the undefined concept of \"historical authenticity\" (UNESCO February 1996: 20 and 28). It is generally acknowledged that the concept of authenticity is a vague one and may be subject to different cultural and social interpretations. Authenticity and its application in relation to the World Heritage Convention was the subject of a conference held in Nara, Japan in November 1994 (Nara Conference on Authenticity in Relation to the World Heritage Convention). A preparatory workshop was held in Bergen in Norway from 31 January to 2 February 1994. The proceedings of the preliminary workshop are published in Larson and Marstein (1994). The Nara Conference resulted in the adoption of a declaration known as The Nara Document on Authenticity. The proceedings of the Nara Conference and the Nara Document on Authenticity are published in Larson (1995). In March 1996 an Inter-American Symposium on Authenticity in the Conservation and Management of Cultural Heritage was held in San Antonio Texas, U.S.A. The Symposium was co-sponsored by US/ICOMOS, the Getty Cosnervation Institute and the San Antonio Conservation Society. see Conservation, Information sources'"
