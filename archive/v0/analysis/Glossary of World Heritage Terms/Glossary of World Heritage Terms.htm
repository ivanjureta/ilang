<B>Preface</B>

This Glossary of World Heritage Terms has been prepared in
accordance with the request of the World Heritage Committee at
its nineteenth session in December 1995. The Committee
requested that the Glossary be a separate document,
independent from, but referring to, the <I>Operational
Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage
Convention </I>and to reports of relevant expert meetings.

<I><B>Action Plan for the Future (Cultural Landscapes)</I></B>

        The <I>Action Plan for the Future (Cultural Landscapes)
        </I>was prepared by the <I>UNESCO</I> "Expert Meeting on
        Cultural Landscapes of Outstanding Universal Value" held in
        Templin, Germany in October 1993 (see von Droste <I>et al
        </I>1995: Annex 1).  The <I>Action Plan </I>outlines
        recommendations concerning the provision of "Guidance to
        States Parties on the Identification, Assessment, Nomination
        and Management of Cultural Landscapes for Inclusion in the
        World Heritage List" and on the preparation of a "Thematic
        Study on Cultural Landscapes".  The <I>Action Plan </I>was
        adopted by the <I>World Heritage Committee</I> at its
        seventeenth session in 1993<I> </I>(UNESCO 4 February 1994:
        55-56 and Annex VII).

<I><B>Advisory bodies</I></B>

        Article 8(3) of the <I>World Heritage Convention
        </I>establishes the <I>International Centre for the Study of
        the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (Rome
        Centre)</I>, now known as <I>ICCROM</I>, the <I>International
        Council of Monuments and Sites</I> (<I>ICOMOS</I>) and the
        <I>International Union for the Conservation of Nature and
        Natural Resources </I>(<I>IUCN</I>), now known as the
        <I>World Conservation Union</I> as <I>advisory bodies </I>to
        the <I>World Heritage Committee</I>.
        
        The <I>Operational Guidelines </I>outline the various rôles
        of the <I>advisory bodies</I> in relation to the
        <I>implementation</I> of the <I>Convention</I> (UNESCO
        February 1996).<I>
        </I>
        The <I>advisory bodies </I>are also referred to as<I>
        advisory organisations</I> in the<I> Operational
        Guidelines</I> (UNESCO February 1996: Paragraphs 49, 50 and
        84).<I></I>

<I><B>Associative cultural landscape</I></B>

        <I>Associative cultural landscape </I>is<I> </I>one of the
        three main categories of <I>cultural landscapes </I>adopted
        by the <I>World Heritage Committee </I>at its sixteenth
        session in December 1992 (UNESCO 14 December 1992: 54-55) and
        included in the <I>Operational Guidelines</I> (UNESCO
        February 1996: 11, Paragraph 39).
        
        Paragraph 39 (iii) of the <I>Operational Guidelines</I>
        refers to <I>associative cultural landscapes</I> in the
        following way:
                
                <B>39.</B>
                
                (iii) The final category is the associative cultural
                      landscape.  The inclusion of such landscapes on 
                      the World Heritage List is justifiable by virtue 
                      of the powerful religious, artistic or cultural 
                      associations of the natural element rather than 
                      material cultural evidence, which may be insignificant 
                      or even absent(UNESCO February 1996: 11, Paragraph 39).

        Tongariro National Park in New Zealand and Ulu<I>r</I>u-Kata
        Tju<I>t</I>a National Park in Australia were included in the
        <I>World Heritage List </I>as <I>associative cultural
        landscapes </I>in 1993 and 1994 respectively (UNESCO 4
        February 1994: 39 and UNESCO 31 January 1995: 52).

        In April 1995 Australia ICOMOS held an "Asia-Pacific Regional
        Workshop on Associative Cultural Landscapes" (von Droste
        <I>et al </I>1995: Annex VI).

<I><B>Authenticity</I></B>

        Also known as <I>Test of authenticity</I> and <I>Conditions
        of authenticity</I>.
        
        Paragraph 24 of the <I>Operational Guidelines</I> requires
        that a <I>cultural property</I> nominated for inclusion in
        the <I>World Heritage List</I> be considered for inclusion
        only if it meets one or more of the <I>cultural heritage
        criteria </I><I>and</I> the <I>test of authenticity</I>.
        
        Paragraph 24 (b) (i) of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>as
        reproduced below<I> </I>refers to the <I>test of
        authenticity</I>.
        
                <B>24.
                   ...</B>
                   (b) (i) meet the test of authenticity in design,
                           material, workmanship or setting and in 
                           the case of cultural landscapes their 
                           distinctive character and components (the 
                           Committee stressed the reconstruction is only
                           acceptable if it is carried out on the basis
                           of complete and detailed documentation on the 
                           original and to no extent on conjecture)
                           (UNESCO February 1996: 7).
        
        The text concerning <I>groups of urban buildings</I> included
        in the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>also refers to the need
        to meet the <I>test of authenticity</I> (UNESCO February
        1996: 8, Paragraph 27).
        
        Paragraphs 57 and 58 of the <I>Operational Guidelines
        </I>state that <I>cultural properties nominated</I> for
        inclusion in the <I>World Heritage List</I> should satisfy
        the <I>conditions of authenticity</I> and that the
        determination as to whether these conditions are met will be
        carried out by <I>ICOMOS</I> (UNESCO February 1996: 18).
        
        Paragraph 64 (e) of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>states
        that "indications as to the authenticity of the property"
        should be included in the completed <I>nomination form
        </I>under the heading of "Justification for inclusion in the
        World Heritage List" (UNESCO February 1996: 20).
        
        Paragraphs 64 (f) (iv) and 78 of the <I>Operational
        Guidelines </I>refer to the undefined concept of "historical
        authenticity" (UNESCO February 1996: 20 and 28).
        
        It is generally acknowledged that the concept of
        <I>authenticity</I> is a vague one and may be subject to
        different cultural and social interpretations. 
        <I>Authenticity</I> and its application in relation to the
        <I>World Heritage Convention </I>was the subject of a
        conference held in Nara, Japan in November 1994 (<I>Nara
        Conference on Authenticity in Relation to the World Heritage
        Convention</I>).  A preparatory workshop was held in Bergen
        in Norway from 31 January to 2 February 1994.  The
        proceedings of the preliminary workshop are published in
        Larson and Marstein (1994).  The <I>Nara Conference</I>
        resulted in the adoption of a declaration known as <I>The
        Nara Document on Authenticity</I>.  The proceedings of the
        <I>Nara Conference</I> and the <I>Nara Document on
        Authenticity</I> are published in Larson (1995).
        
        In March 1996 an Inter-American Symposium on Authenticity in
        the Conservation and Management of Cultural Heritage was held
        in San Antonio Texas, U.S.A.  The Symposium was co-sponsored
        by US/ICOMOS, the Getty Cosnervation Institute and the San
        Antonio Conservation Society.

<I><B>Balance</I></B>
        
        <I>Balance </I>is first referred to in Paragraph 6(iii) of
        the <I>Operational Guidelines</I> with reference to efforts
        to maintain a "reasonable balance between the numbers of
        cultural heritage and the natural heritage properties"
        included in the <I>World Heritage List</I>.  This statement
        is reaffirmed in Paragraph 15 of the <I>Operational
        Guidelines </I>(UNESCO February 1996: 2, 3 and 5) and is in
        conformity with the <I>spirit of the Convention </I>as an
        instrument for the conservation of both the natural and the
        cultural heritage.
        
        In the section of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>concerned
        with the granting of <I>international assistance</I>,
        Paragraph 111 states that a "balance will be maintained
        between funds allocated to projects for the preservation of
        the cultural heritage on the one hand and projects for the
        conservation of the natural heritage on the other hand"
        (UNESCO February 1996: 38).
        
        Section VI of the <I>Operational Guidelines</I> is entitled
        "Balance between the Cultural and the Natural Heritage in the
        Implementation of the Convention" (UNESCO February 1996: 40-
        41).  Paragraph 121 outlines a number of measures recommended
        by the <I>Committee </I>to achieve this <I>balance</I>
        (UNESCO February 1996: 40-41).
        
        The <I>balance</I> between the numbers of <I>natural</I> and
        <I>cultural properties</I> <I>inscribed </I>in the <I>World
        Heritage List </I>was the subject of discussion at the March
        1996 "Expert Meeting on Evaluation of general principles and
        criteria for nominations of natural World Heritage sites"
        (UNESCO 15 April 1996).  The report of the Expert Meeting
        notes that ""balance" is not about numbers, but about
        representativity for biogeographical regions or events in the
        history of life" (UNESCO 15 April 1996: 6).  The World
        Heritage Bureau and Committee will consider the substance of
        the report of the Expert Meeting at their twentieth sessions
        in 1996.
        
<I><B>Biogeographic(al) provinces</I></B>

        In the <I>Operational Guidelines</I>,<I> biogeographic(al)
        provinces</I> are suggested as an appropriate comparative
        unit for grouping similar <I>natural properties</I> when
        preparing <I>tentative lists</I> (Paragraph 8), for
        nominating a <I>series </I>of<I> natural properties</I> for
        <I>nomination</I> to the <I>World Heritage List
        </I>(Paragraph 19(iii)) and for <I>IUCN</I> when preparing
        relative <I>evaluations</I> of <I>natural properties</I>
        (Paragraph 60) (UNESCO February 1996: 6 and 18).

<I><B>Buffer zone</I></B>

        Paragraph 17 of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>defines a
        <I>buffer zone</I> as:
        
                ... an area surrounding the property which has
                restrictions placed on its use to give an added layer of
                protection; the area constituting the buffer zone should
                be determined in each case through technical studies
                (UNESCO February 1996: 5).
        
        Paragraph 17 of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>further
        states that:
        
                Whenever necessary for the proper conservation of a
                cultural or natural property nominated, an adequate
                "buffer zone" around a property should be provided and
                should be afforded the necessary protection ... Details
                on the size, characteristics and authorized uses of a
                buffer zone, as well as a map indicating its precise
                boundaries, should be provided in the nomination file
                relating to the property in question (UNESCO February
                1996: 5).

<I><B>Canal</I></B>

        In September 1994 a meeting on "Heritage Canals" was held at
        Chaffeys Lock, Ontario, Canada.  The expert meeting defined a
        <I>canal </I>as:<I>
                </I>
                ... a human-engineered waterway.  It may be of
                outstanding universal value from the point of view of
                history or technology, either intrinsically or as an
                exceptional example representative of this category of
                cultural property.  The canal may be a monumental work,
                the defining features of a linear cultural landscape, or
                an integral component of a complex cultural landscape
                (von Droste <I>et al </I>1995: 433, Annex III).

<I><B>Clearly defined landscape</I></B>

        <I>Clearly defined landscape </I>is one of the three main
        categories of <I>cultural landscapes </I>adopted by the
        <I>World Heritage Committee </I>at its sixteenth session in
        December 1992 (UNESCO 14 December 1992: 54-55) and included
        in the <I>Operational Guidelines</I> (UNESCO February 1996:
        11, Paragraph 39).
        
        Paragraph 39 (i) of the <I>Operational Guidelines</I> refers
        to <I>clearly defined landscapes</I> in the following way:
        
                <B>39.
                </B>
                (i)  The most easily identifiable is the clearly defined
                     landscape designed and created intentionally by man.  
                     This embraces garden and parkland landscapes constructed 
                     for aesthetic reasons which are often (but not always) 
                     associated with religious or other monumental buildings 
                     and ensembles (UNESCO February 1996: 11).

<I><B>CNPPA

        The <I>CNPPA (Commission on National Parks and Protected

        <I>IUCN</I> - <I>The World Conservation Union</I>.  The
        <I>CNPPA </I>is the largest worldwide network of protected
        area managers and specialists.  The <I>CNPPA </I>mission is
        to promote the establishment and effective management of a
        worldwide network of terrestrial and marine protected areas.

<I><B>Comparative assessment</B>s</I>

        In stating that properties included in the <I>World Heritage
        List</I> should be carefully selected, Paragraph 9 of the
        <I>Operational Guidelines </I>further comments that
        "comparative assessments for the harmonization of tentative
        lists and nominations of cultural properties" should be
        performed (UNESCO February 1996: 4).

<I><B>Comparative evaluations</I></B>

        Paragraph 12 of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>refers to
        the requirement when nominating <I>cultural properties</I>
        belonging to "certain well-represented categories" to prepare
        "a comparative evaluation of the property in relation to
        other properties of a similar type" (UNESCO February 1996: 5).
        
        In presenting "Guidelines for the evaluation and examination
        of nominations" the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>state that
        "ICOMOS is requested to make comparative evaluations of
        properties belonging to the same type of cultural property"
        (UNESCO February 1996: 18-19, Paragraph 61(c)).  The
        <I>Operational Guidelines </I>do not contain a similar
        requirement for IUCN in evaluating natural properties.

<I><B>Conservation</I></B>

        The <I>World Heritage Convention </I>does not specifically
        define <I>conservation</I>.  Throughout the <I>Convention
        </I>reference is made to the "identification, protection,
        conservation, presentation and transmission to future
        generations of the cultural and natural heritage".  Article 5
        of the <I>Convention </I>makes reference to a number of
        "effective and active measures" that can be taken by
        <I>States Parties</I> in ensuring this "identification,
        protection, conservation, presentation and transmission"
        (UNESCO 1972).
        
        The <I>Operational Guidelines </I>do not include a definition
        of <I>conservation</I>.  The <I>Operational Guidelines
        </I>state that one of the four essential functions of the
        <I>World Heritage Committee </I>is to "monitor the state of
        conservation of properties inscribed on the World Heritage
        List" (UNESCO February 1996: 2, Paragraph 3 (ii)). 
        Guidelines for <I>monitoring </I>the "state of conservation"
        of <I>properties </I>inscribed in the <I>World Heritage List
        </I>feature prominently in the <I>Operational Guidelines
        </I>(UNESCO February 1996: Section II).  The term
        <I>preservation</I> and <I>conservation</I> are used
        interchangeably to refer to the "State of
        preservation/conservation" section of the <I>nomination
        form</I> (UNESCO February 1996: 20, Paragraph 64 (d)).
        
        Paragraph 24 (b) (ii) of the <I>Operational Guidelines
        </I>stipulates that <I>cultural properties </I>included in
        the <I>World Heritage List</I> must "have adequate legal
        and/or contractual and/or traditional protection and
        management mechanisms to ensure the conservation of the
        nominated cultural properties or cultural landscapes" (UNESCO
        February 1996: 7-8).<I></I>
        
        The <I>Operational Guidelines </I>also include reference,
        without definition, to "conservation policy" (Paragraph 27
        (ii)), "conservation scheme" (Paragraph 34), "preventive
        conservation" (Paragraph 69) and "day-to-day conservation"
        (Paragraph 70) (UNESCO February 1996: 8, 10 and 26).
        
        <I>Conservation </I>is used interchangeably with
        <I>preservation</I>, <I>safeguarding</I> and <I>protection
        </I>in the <I>Operational Guidelines</I>.<I></I>
        
        <I>The Nara Document on Authenticity </I>defines
        <I>conservation</I>, specifically with reference to the
        <I>cultural heritage</I>, as:
        
                <I>Conservation</I>:  all efforts designed to understand
                cultural heritage, know its history and meaning, ensure
                its material safeguard and, as required, its
                presentation, restoration and enhancement (Larson 1995:
                xxv).
        
        The French definition of <I>Conservation</I> is also included
        in Larson (1995: xxxi).

        The <I>Convention concerning the protection of the world
        cultural and natural heritage </I>was adopted by the General
        Conference of UNESCO at its seventeenth session in Paris on
        16 November 1972 (UNESCO 1972).  The <I>Convention</I>, with
        146 signatory <I>States Parties </I>as of June 1996, is the
        most successful international heritage conservation
        instrument in the world.  The <I>Convention </I>responds to
        the increasing threats to <I>cultural heritage</I> and
        <I>natural heritage </I>caused by poverty in many countries,
        neglect, and in some countries, by unconsidered economic
        growth and development and seeks to encourage <I>States
        Parties </I>to identify, protect, preserve and present
        <I>cultural heritage </I>and <I>natural heritage </I>for
        future generations in a spirit of international cooperation.
        
        As the first step in the <I>World Heritage</I> conservation
        process, <I>cultural properties </I>and <I>natural properties
        </I>of <I>outstanding universal value</I> are <I>identified
        </I>and included on the <I>World Heritage List</I>.  The
        <I>World Heritage Committee </I>has inscribed 469 properties
        on the <I>World Heritage List</I>.  The <I>Convention
        </I>also establishes a <I>World Heritage Fund </I>from which
        assistance is available for the <I>identification </I>and
        <I>conservation </I>of the world's heritage.

        <I>Corrective measures </I>are referred to in Paragraphs 22,
        46, 47, 82 and 83 of the <I>Operational Guidelines
        </I>without specific definition (UNESCO February 1996: 6, 15
        and 30).
        
        In Paragraph 22 an "action plan outlining corrective
        measures" is required when a <I>State Party </I>nominates a
        <I>property</I> that meets the <I>criteria </I>and the
        <I>conditions of authenticity</I> and/or <I>integrity </I>but
        which is threatened by human action.  Similar reference is
        made in Paragraphs 46 and 47 (UNESCO February 1996: 6 and
        15).
        
        Paragraphs 82 and 83 of the <I>Operational Guidelines</I>
        refer to the development of "a programme of corrective
        measures" in the section on the "Procedure for the inclusion
        of properties in the List of World Heritage in Danger"
        (UNESCO February 1996: 30).
        
<I><B>Criteria</I></B>

        Paragraphs 2 and 5 of Article 11 of the <I>Convention
        </I>refer to the definition and establishment of <I>criteria
        </I>on the basis of which a <I>property </I>belonging to the
        <I>cultural </I>or <I>natural heritage </I>may be included in
        the <I>World Heritage List</I> and/or the <I>List of World
        Heritage in Danger</I>, by the <I>World Heritage
        Committee</I> (UNESCO 1972).
        
        In accordance with Article 11 of the <I>Convention</I>, the
        <I>World Heritage Committee </I>have established
        <I>criteria</I> for the inclusion of <I>cultural properties
        </I>and <I>natural properties </I>in the <I>World Heritage

                <I>Article 1</I>
                         
                For the purpose of this Convention, the following
                shall be considered as "cultural heritage":
                         
                monuments: architectural works, works of monumental
                sculpture and painting, elements or structures of
                an archaeological nature, inscriptions, cave
                dwellings and combinations of features, which are
                of outstanding universal value from the point of
                view of history, art or science;
                groups of buildings: groups of separate or
                connected buildings which, because of their
                architecture, their homogeneity or their place in
                the landscape, are of outstanding universal value
                from the point of view of history, art or science;
                sites: works of man or the combined works of nature
                and man, and areas including archaeological sites
                which are of outstanding universal value from the
                historical, aesthetic, ethnological or
                anthropological point of view (UNESCO 1972).

<I><B>Cultural landscapes</I></B>

        At its sixteenth session in December 1992 the <I>World
        Heritage Committee </I>adopted three main categories of
        <I>cultural landscapes </I>(UNESCO 14 December 1992: 54-55)
        and included guidelines concerning their inclusion in the
        <I>World Heritage List </I>in the <I>Operational
        Guidelines</I> (UNESCO February 1996: 10-12, Paragraphs 35 to
        42).
        Paragraphs 36 to 38 of the <I>Operational Guidelines
        </I>provide some definition of <I>cultural landscapes</I>.
        
                <B>36.</B>  Cultural landscapes represent the "combined
                works of nature and of man" designated in Article 1 of
                the Convention.  They are illustrative of the evolution
                of human society and settlement over time, under the
                influence of the physical constraints and/or
                opportunities presented by their natural environment and
                of successive social, economic and cultural forces, both
                external and internal.  They should be selected on the
                basis both of their outstanding universal value and of
                their representativity in terms of a clearly defined
                geo-cultural region and also for their capacity to
                illustrate the essential and distinct cultural elements
                of such regions.
                
                <B>37.</B>  The term "cultural landscape" embraces a
                diversity of manifestations of the interaction between
                humankind and its natural environment.
                
                <B>38.</B>  Cultural landscapes often reflect
                specific techniques of sustainable land-use, considering
                the characteristics and limits of the natural
                environment they are established in, and a specific
                spiritual relation to nature.  Protection of cultural
                landscapes can contribute to modern techniques of
                sustainable land-use and can maintain or enhance natural
                values in the landscape.  The continued existence of
                traditional forms of land-use supports biological
                diversity in many regions of the world.  The protection
                of traditional cultural landscapes is therefore helpful
                in maintaining biological diversity (UNESCO February
                1996: 10-11).
                
        Paragraph 39 of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>refers to
        <I>cultural landscapes </I>as falling into three main
        categories - the<I> clearly defined landscape</I>, the
        <I>organically evolved landscape</I> (including <I>relict (or
        fossil) landscapes</I> and <I>continuing landscapes</I>) and
        <I>associative cultural landscapes</I> (UNESCO February 1996:
        11).<I></I>
        
        Paragraphs 40 to 42 of the <I>Operational Guidelines
        </I>provide some further guidance concerning the inclusion of
        <I>cultural landscapes</I> in the <I>World Heritage List</I>
        (UNESCO February 1996: 11-12).

        Since 1992 several regional and thematic meetings on the
        subject of <I>cultural landscapes</I> of <I>outstanding
        universal value </I>have been held (see for example, von
        Droste <I>et al </I>1995, von Droste <I>et al </I>1995:
        Annexes II to VI and UNESCO 21 April 1996).

        the nominating government" to protect the <I>property</I>
        (UNESCO February 1996: 3, Paragraph 6 (v)).
        
        Paragraph 32 of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>recommends
        that examination of <I>nominations </I>of "new towns of the
        twentieth century" should be <I>deferred </I>pending the
        passage of time (UNESCO February 1996: 10).
        
        The <I>Bureau </I>and <I>Committee </I>may <I>defer</I> the
        examination of a <I>property</I> for inclusion in the
        <I>World Heritage List</I> pending the completion of an "in-
        depth assessment or study" (UNESCO February 1996: 24,

<I><B>Deletion</I></B>

        <I>Deletion </I>of a <I>property </I>from the <I>World

        A <I>property</I> may be <I>deleted</I> or removed from the
        <I>List of World Heritage in Danger</I> when that
        <I>property</I> is no longer under threat (UNESCO February
        1996: 31, Paragraph 89).
        
        A <I>property </I>may be <I>deleted</I> from both the <I>List
        of World Heritage in Danger</I> and the <I>World Heritage
        List</I> if the <I>property</I> has deteriorated to the
        extent that it has lost those characteristics which
        determined its inclusion in the <I>World Heritage List</I>
        (UNESCO February 1996: 31, Paragraph 89).
        
        The <I>Operational Guidelines </I>outline a procedure
        concerning the possible <I>deletion</I> of a property from
        the <I>World Heritage List</I> in Paragraphs 46 to 54 (UNESCO

<I><B>Evaluation</I></B>

        Section F of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>establishes
        "Guidelines for the evaluation and examination of
        nominations" (UNESCO February 1996: 18-19).  At the beginning
        of Section F, Paragraph 57 states that:
        
                The evaluation of whether or not individual sites
                nominated by States Parties satisfy the criteria and the
                conditions of authenticity/integrity will be carried out
                by the International Council on Monuments and Sites
                (ICOMOS) for cultural properties and by the World

<I><B>Global Strategy</I></B>

        The <I>Global Strategy </I>is a conceptual framework devised
        to ensure the representativeness and credibility of the
        <I>World Heritage List</I>.  The <I>Global Strategy </I>was
        adopted by the <I>World Heritage Committee</I> at its
        eighteenth session in 1994 (UNESCO 13 October 1994). 
        
        The <I>Global Strategy </I>was originally devised with
        particular reference to <I>cultural heritage</I>.  In March
        1996 a group of experts meeting in the Parc National de la
        Vanoise, France, affirmed the application of the <I>Global
        Strategy </I>for <I>natural heritage</I> (UNESCO 15 April
        1996). The World Heritage Bureau and Committee will consider
        the substance of the report of the group of experts at their
        twentieth sessions in 1996.

        The regional and thematic meetings held on the subject of
        <I>cultural landscapes</I> of <I>outstanding universal value
        </I>(see for example, von Droste <I>et al </I>1995, von
        Droste <I>et al </I>1995: Annexes 11 to VI and UNESCO 21
        April 1996) and meetings on <I>authenticity </I>(Larson and
        Marstein 1994, Larson 1995 and Inter-American Symposium on
        Authenticity, March 1996) are all important contributions to
        the aims of the <I>Global Strategy</I>.

        The first subregional meeting on the Global Strategy was held
        in Harare, Zimbabwe from 11 to 13 October 1995 (UNESCO 31
        January 1996: 53-54).

<I><B>Groups of buildings</I></B>

        <I>Groups of buildings </I>are referred to as part of the

<I><B>Groups of urban buildings</I></B>

        The <I>World Heritage Committee </I>has adopted guidelines
        concerning the <I>inclusion </I>of <I>groups of urban
        buildings </I>in the <I>World Heritage List</I> (UNESCO
        February 1996: 8-10, Paragraphs 26-34).<I></I>
        
        Paragraph 27 of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>refers to
        <I>groups of urban buildings </I>as falling into three main
        categories - the towns which are no longer inhabited but
        which provide unchanged archaeological evidence of the past,
        historic towns which are still inhabited (<I>inhabited
        historic towns</I>) and new towns of the twentieth century
        (UNESCO February 1996: 8).

<I><B>Harmonization</I></B>

        To ensure the careful selection of <I>properties</I> for
        inclusion in the <I>World Heritage List</I> the <I>Committee
        </I>has recommended the <I>harmonization </I>of <I>tentative
        lists</I> and of <I>cultural properties</I> for geo-cultural
        regions or areas (UNESCO February 1996: 4 and 31, Paragraph 9
        and Paragraph 90).
        
        <I>Harmonization </I>is not mentioned in the <I>Operational
        Guidelines</I> with reference to <I>natural properties </I>or
        their inclusion on <I>tentative lists</I>.

<I><B>Heritage route</I></B>
<I></I>
        In November 1994 a meeting on "Routes as Part of Our Cultural
        Heritage" was held in Madrid, Spain.  The expert meeting
        defined a <I>heritage route</I> as:<I>
</I>
                ... composed of tangible elements of which the cultural
                significance comes from exchanges and a multi-
                dimensional dialogue across countries or regions, and
                that illustrate the interaction of movement, along the
                route, in space and time (von Droste <I>et al </I>1995:
                437, Annex IV).

        <I>ICCROM </I>was created by <I>UNESCO </I>in 1956. 
        <I>ICCROM </I>was formerly known as the <I>Rome Centre</I>. 
        In 1977 the name was changed to ICCROM (the initials of the

<I><B>Identification</I></B>

        The <I>World Heritage Convention </I>does not specifically
        define <I>identification</I>.  Throughout the <I>Convention
        </I>reference is made to the "identification, protection,
        conservation, presentation and transmission to future
        generations of the cultural and natural heritage".  Article 5
        of the <I>Convention </I>makes reference to a number of
        "effective and active measures" that can be taken by
        <I>States Parties </I>in ensuring this "identification,
        protection, conservation, presentation and transmission"
        (UNESCO 1972).
        
        Within the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>the
        <I>identification </I>of <I>properties</I> for potential
        <I>inclusion </I>in the <I>World Heritage List </I>is
        referred to as the first step in the process of <I>World
        Heritage conservation</I> (UNESCO February 1996: 1, 17 and
        32, Paragraphs 2, 54 and 94).
        
        An <I>identification </I>section is included as part of the
        <I>nomination form </I>(UNESCO February 1996: 20, Paragraph
        64 (c) and UNESCO 1995).
        
<I><B>Identification number</I></B>

        The <I>identification number</I>, abbreviated to <I>ID
        No</I>, is an accession number given to each <I>property
        </I>for which a completed <I>nomination form </I>is received

<I><B>Implementation</I></B>

        <I>Implementation </I>refers to the act of putting the
        <I>Convention </I>into practice.<I></I>

<I><B>Immovable property</I></B>

        <I>Immovable property </I>is <I>property </I>that cannot
        easily be moved.  The opposite of <I>immovable property
        </I>is <I>movable property</I>.  As the <I>Convention
        </I>does not consider <I>nominations </I>of <I>immovable
        property</I> "which are likely to become movable" (UNESCO
        February 1996: 8, Paragraph 25).

see <I>Movable property</I>

<I><B>Indicative list</I></B>

        The term <I>indicative list </I>is sometimes used to refer to
        the <I>inventory of property </I>mentioned in Article 11(1)
        of the <I>Convention</I>.  In the French language version of
        the <I>Operational Guidelines</I>, the "Orientations devant
        guider las mise en oeuvre de al Convention du patrimoine
        mondial", "une liste indicative" is used to refer to this
        <I>inventory of property</I>. Despite this the English
        language version of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>refers
        to <I>tentative list </I>and not to <I>indicative list</I>.

see <I>Inventory of property</I>,<I> Tentative list</I>

<I><B>Information sources</I></B>

        <I>The Nara Document on Authenticity </I>defines
        <I>information sources</I> as:
        
                <I>Information sources</I>:  all material, written, oral
                and figurative sources which make it possible to know
                the nature, specifications, meaning and history of the
                cultural heritage (Larson 1995: xxv).
        
        The French definition of <I>Sources d'information</I> is also
        included in Larson (1995: xxxi).

<I><B>Inhabited historic towns
</I></B>
        Paragraph 29 of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>provides
        some definition of <I>inhabited historic towns </I>as:
                
                (i)      Towns which are typical of a specific period or
                         culture, which have been almost wholly preserved
                         and which have remained largely unaffected by
                         subsequent developments. Here the property to be
                         listed is the entire town together with its
                         surroundings, which must also be protected;
                     
                (ii)     Towns that have evolved along characteristic lines
                         and have preserved, sometimes in the midst of
                         exceptional natural surroundings, spatial
                         arrangements and structures that are typical of the
                         successive stages in their history. Here the
                         clearly defined historic part takes precedence over
                         the contemporary environment;
                     
                (iii)    "Historic centres" that cover exactly the same
                         area as ancient towns and are now enclosed
                         within modern cities. Here it is necessary to
                         determine the precise limits of the property
                         in its widest historical dimensions and to
                         make appropriate provision for its immediate
                         surroundings;
                     
                (iv)     Sectors, areas or isolated units which, even in the
                         residual state in which they have survived, provide
                         coherent evidence of the character of a historic
                         town which has disappeared. In such cases surviving
                         areas and buildings should bear sufficient
                         testimony to the former whole (UNESCO February
                         1996: 9).

<I><B>Integrity</I></B>

        Also known as <I>Conditions of integrity</I>.
        
        The concept of <I>integrity </I>is not referred to directly
        in the <I>World Heritage Convention</I>.
        
        Paragraph 44 of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>requires
        that a <I>natural property </I>nominated for inclusion in the
        <I>World Heritage List </I>be considered for inclusion only
        if it meets one or more of the <I>natural heritage criteria
        </I><I>and</I> fulfils the <I>conditions of integrity</I>
        (UNESCO February 1996: 12).  This requirement is again
        referred to in Paragraph 45 of the <I>Operational
        Guidelines</I> (UNESCO February 1996: 15).<I></I>
        
        The <I>conditions of integrity </I>may be summarised from
        Paragraph 44 (b) (i) to (iv) of the <I>Operational
        Guidelines</I> as follows:<I></I>

                         (ii)    The sites described in 44(a)(ii) should have
                                 sufficient size and contain the necessary
                                 elements to demonstrate the key aspects of
                                 processes that are essential for the long-term
                                 conservation of the ecosystems and the
                                 biological diversity they contain ...
                               
                         (iii)   The sites described in 44(a)(iii) should
                                 be of outstanding aesthetic value and
                                 include areas that are essential for
                                 maintaining the beauty of the site ...
                               
                         (iv)    The sites described in paragraph 44(a)(iv)
                                 should contain habitats for maintaining the
                                 most diverse fauna and flora characteristic of
                                 the biogeographic province and ecosystems

                                 (UNESCO February 1996: 13-14).
        
        Paragraphs 57 and 58 of the <I>Operational Guidelines
        </I>state that <I>natural properties </I>nominated for
        inclusion in the <I>World Heritage List </I>should satisfy
        the <I>conditions of integrity </I>and that the determination
        as to whether these conditions are met will be carried out by
        <I>IUCN</I>  (UNESCO February 1996: 18).  Furthermore,
        Paragraph 58 (d) of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>also
        requests that <I>IUCN </I>in examining and evaluating
        nominations, "make comments and recommendations on the
        integrity and future management of each property recommended
        by the Bureau, during its presentation to the Committee"
        (UNESCO February 1996: 19).
        
        The <I>Operational Guidelines </I>refer to the threat to the
        <I>integrity</I> of <I>natural properties</I> as one of the
        <I>criterion</I> for the inclusion of <I>natural properties
        </I>in the <I>List of World Heritage in Danger </I>(UNESCO
        February 1996: 29, Paragraph 79 (i) (c)).  Paragraph 80 of
        the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>makes comments concerning
        how threats to the <I>integrity</I> of <I>natural properties
        </I>may be "amenable to correction by human action" or by
        "administrative or legislative action, such as the cancelling
        of a major public works project or the improvement of legal
        status" (UNESCO February 1996: 29).
        
        On only one occasion the concept of <I>integrity </I>is
        referred to with reference to the <I>conservation </I>of
        <I>cultural properties</I>.  In Paragraph 24 (b)(ii) of the
        <I>Operational Guidelines </I>reference is made to the need
        to "preserve the integrity of cultural sites" (UNESCO
        February 1996: 8).
        
        The possibility of applying conditions of <I>integrity</I> to
        both<I> natural heritage </I>and <I>cultural heritage</I>,
        "and<I> </I>thus of applying one common approach for the
        identification and evaluation of World Heritage" was the
        subject of discussion at the March 1996 "Expert Meeting on
        Evaluation of general principles and criteria for nominations
        of natural World Heritage sites" (UNESCO 15 April 1996).  The
        <I>World Heritage Bureau </I>and <I>Committee </I>will
        consider the substance of the report of the Expert Meeting at
        their twentieth sessions in 1996.

<I><B>International assistance</I></B>

        The granting of collective assistance, such as
        <I>international assistance,</I> through the participation of
        the international community is one of the fundamental
        conservation tools established by the <I>Convention</I> and
        is referred to in the Preamble to the <I>Convention</I>
        UNESCO 1972).
        
        The <I>Convention </I>includes significant detail concerning
        the provision of <I>international assistance</I> - see for
        example Article 13, and Section V "Conditions and
        Arrangements for International Assistance, Articles 19-26
        (UNESCO 1972).  The <I>Convention </I>states that
        <I>international assistance </I>may be used to identify,
        "secure the protection, conservation, presentation or
        rehabilitation" of a <I>cultural </I>or <I>natural property
        </I>(UNESCO 1972: Article 13 (1) and (2)).
        
        Section IV of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>entitled
        "International Assistance" describes the various forms of
        assistance available under the <I>World Heritage Fund
        </I>(<I>Preparatory assistance</I>, <I>Emergency
        assistance</I>, <I>Training</I>, <I>Technical co-operation
        </I>and assistance for<I> promotional activities</I>),
        establishes the deadlines for the presentation of requests
        for <I>international assistance </I>for consideration by the
        <I>World Heritage Committee</I> and its <I>Bureau</I>,

                protection of the world cultural and natural heritage
                shall be understood to mean the establishment of a
                system of international co-operation and assistance
                designed to support States Parties to the Convention in
                their efforts to conserve and identify that heritage
                (UNESCO 1972).

            1.           Every State Party to this Convention shall, in so
                         far as possible, submit to the World Heritage
                         Committee an inventory of property forming part of
                         the cultural and natural heritage, situated in its
                         territory and suitable for inclusion in the list

                         shall not be considered exhaustive, shall include
                         documentation about the location of the property in
                         question and its significance (UNESCO 1972).
        
        This <I>inventory</I> is referred to in the <I>Operational

<B>IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature and
Natural Resources) - The World Conservation Union</I></B>

        Founded in 1948, the <I>IUCN - The World Conservation
        Union</I> brings together States, government agencies and a
        diverse range of non-governmental organisations in a world
        partnership.  The <I>IUCN</I> is an international, non-
        governmental organization with more than 800 members from 125
        countries.  The <I>IUCN</I> seeks to ensure the
        <I>conservation </I>of the <I>integrity </I>and diversity of
        nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is
        equitable and ecologically sustainable.
        
        Article 8 (3) of the <I>Convention</I> requires that a
        representative of <I>IUCN</I> attend meetings of the
        <I>Committee</I> in an advisory capacity (UNESCO 1972).

        The <I>IUCN </I>advises the <I>World Heritage Committee
        </I>on the selection of <I>natural properties </I>for
        inclusion in the <I>World Heritage List</I>, and through its
        worldwide network of specialists, reports back on the
        <I>state of conservation </I>of inscribed <I>properties</I>.

<I><B>IUCN evaluation</I></B>

        The <I>evaluation </I>procedures used by <I>IUCN</I> for
        <I>natural property nominations </I>are set out in the
        <I>IUCN</I> volume on "Documentation on World Heritage
        Properties (Natural)" presented by <I>IUCN </I>to the
        <I>World Heritage Committee </I>each year (see for example

        <I>natural properties</I> for <I>inclusion </I>in the
        <I>World Heritage List </I>is conducted by the Natural

        the IUCN's <I>Commission on National Parks and Protected
        Areas</I> (<I>CNPPA</I>).  The <I>IUCN </I>uses a standard
        format in presenting its documentation on <I>natural property
        nominations</I>.  The documentation provided by <I>IUCN</I>
        is in three parts - a summary of the original <I>nomination

<I><B>Justification</I></B>

        Section G of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>entitled
        "Format and content of nominations" provides guidance as to
        how States Parties should justify the inclusion of
        <I>properties</I> in the <I>World Heritage List</I>.

                Information should be provided under three separate
                headings as follows: (i) the reasons for which the
                property is considered to meet one or more of the
                criteria set out under paragraphs 24 and 44 above; (ii)
                an evaluation of the property's present state of
                preservation as compared with similar properties
                elsewhere; (iii) indications as to the authenticity of
                the property (UNESCO February 1996: 20, Paragraph 64
                (e)).

        The <I>nomination form </I>includes specific requirements for
        justifying <I>cultural </I>and/or <I>natural property
        nominations</I>.

        <I>Nominations </I>of <I>properties </I>for inclusion in the
        <I>World Heritage List</I>, should be well justified and
        presented "in the form of a well-argued case" making
        reference to the <I>natural </I>and/or <I>cultural heritage

List of World Heritage in Danger</I></B>

        The <I>List of World Heritage in Danger</I> is clearly
        defined in Article 11 (4) of the <I>Convention</I>:

                1.       ... a list of the property appearing in the World
                         Heritage List for the conservation of which major
                         operations are necessary and for which assistance
                         has been requested under the Convention.  This list
                         shall contain an estimate of the cost of such
                         operations.  The list may include only such
                         property forming part of the cultural and natural
                         heritage as is threatened by serious and specific
                         dangers, such as the threat of disappearance caused
                         by accelerated deterioration, large-scale public or
                         private projects or rapid urban or tourist
                         development projects: destruction caused by changes
                         in the use or ownership of the land; major
                         alterations due to unknown causes; abandonment for
                         any reason whatsoever; the outbreak or the threat
                         of an armed conflict; calamities and cataclysms;
                         serious fires, earthquakes, landslides; volcanic
                         eruptions; changes in water level, floods, and
                         tidal waves.  The Committee may at any time, in
                         case of urgent need, make a new entry in the List
                         of World Heritage in Danger and publicize such
                         entry immediately (UNESCO 1972).

        Paragraph 6(vi) of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>states
        that,

                (i)      When a property has deteriorated to the extent that
                         it has lost those characteristics which determined
                         its inclusion in the World Heritage List.  It should
                         be placed on the World Heritage in Danger List,
                         subsequently the procedure concerning the possible
                         deletion from the List will be applied  (UNESCO
                         February 1996: 3).

        There are currently 18 <I>properties </I>included in the

        Paragraph 63 of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>clearly

        justified the <I>inclusion</I> of a <I>property </I>in the
        <I>World Heritage List </I> should be reflected in its future
        <I>management</I> (UNESCO February 1996: 19).
<B>
<I>Management plan</I></B>

        <I>States Parties </I>to the <I>Convention </I>are encouraged
        to prepare <I>management plans </I>for the <I>management</I>
        of each <I>cultural</I> and <I>natural property nominated
        </I>for <I>inclusion </I>in the <I>World Heritage List</I>
        (UNESCO February 1996: 6, Paragraph 21).  This requirement is
        reflected in the <I>conditions of integrity</I> for
        <I>natural properties </I>(UNESCO February 1996: 14-15,
        Paragraphs 44 (b)(v) and (vi)) and in the requirements

<I><B>Mixed property</I></B>

        17 <I>properties </I>are currently included in the <I>World

        cultural values (UNESCO-ICOMOS Documentation Centre 1996). 
        Although these types of <I>World Heritage properties</I> are
        generally known as <I>mixed properties</I>,<I> </I>the
        <I>Operational Guidelines </I>does not use, refer to, or
        define this term.  The <I>Operational Guidelines </I>do
        however state that "States Parties should as far as possible
        endeavour to include in their submissions properties which
        derive their outstanding universal value from a particularly
        significant combination of cultural and natural features"

        The "Report of the Expert Meeting on Evaluation of general
        principles and criteria for nominations of natural World
        Heritage sites" held at the Parc national de la Vanoise,
        France on 22 to 24 March 1996 (UNESCO 15 April 1996) includes
        the following definition of <I>natural area</I>:

                A natural area is one where bio-physical processes and
                landform features are still relatively intact and where
                a primary management goal of the area is to ensure that
                natural values are protected.  The term "natural" is a
                relative one.  It is recognized that no area is totally
                pristine and that all natural areas are in a dynamic
                state.  Human activities in natural areas often occur
                and when sustainable may complement the natural values
                of the area (UNESCO 15 April 1996: 3).
                
        The <I>World Heritage Bureau</I> and <I>Committee </I>will

Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World
Heritage Convention</I></B>

        The <I>Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the
        World Heritage Convention</I>, known also as the
        <I>Operational Guidelines</I> or simply as the
        <I>Guidelines</I>, were prepared by the <I>World Heritage
        Committee </I>for the purpose of informing <I>States
        Parties</I> to the <I>Convention</I> of the principles which
        guide the work of the <I>World Heritage Committee</I> in
        establishing the <I>World Heritage List</I>, the <I>List of
        World Heritage in Danger </I>and in granting <I>international
        assistance</I> under the <I>World Heritage Fund </I>(see
        UNESCO February 1996: 1-2, Paragraph 4).  The <I>Operational
        Guidelines</I> provide guidance concerning the format and
        content of <I>nominations </I>to the <I>World Heritage List
        </I>and present the <I>timetable</I> for submission and
        <I>evaluation </I>of the <I>nominations</I>.  The
        <I>Operational Guidelines</I> also provide details on other
        questions, mainly of a procedural nature, which relate to the
        <I>implementation</I> of the <I>Convention</I>.  Most
        importantly the <I>Operational Guidelines</I> present the
        "Criteria for the inclusion of cultural properties in the
        World Heritage List" and the "Criteria for the inclusion of
        natural properties in the World Heritage List".
        
        The <I>Operational Guidelines</I> have been prepared with the
        intention of ensuring objective and scientific decision-
        making on the part of the <I>World Heritage Committee</I>.
        
        The first version of the <I>Operational Guidelines </I>were
        adopted by the <I>World Heritage Committee</I> in 1977. 
        Since 1977 the <I>Operational Guidelines</I> have been
        adjusted and expanded to reflect the subsequent decisions of
        the <I>Committee.  </I>Nine major revisions of the
        <I>Operational Guidelines</I> had been produced and adopted
        by the World Heritage Committee up until June 1996.
        
<I><B>Organically evolved landscape</I></B>
        
        <I>Organically evolved landscape </I>is one of the three main
        categories of <I>cultural landscapes </I>adopted by the
        <I>World Heritage Committee </I>at its sixteenth session in
        December 1992 (UNESCO 14 December 1992: 54-55) and included
        in the <I>Operational Guidelines</I> (UNESCO February 1996:
        11, Paragraph 39).
        
        Paragraph 39 (ii) of the <I>Operational Guidelines</I> refers
        to <I>organically evolved landscapes</I> in the following
        way:
        
                <B>39.</B>

                (i)      The second category is the organically evolved
                         landscape.  This results from an initial social,
                         economic, administrative, and/or religious imperative
                         and has developed its present form by association
                         with and in response to its natural environment. 
                         Such landscapes reflect that process of evolution in
                         their form and component features.  They fall into
                         two sub-categories:
                
                         -   a relict (or fossil) landscape is one in which an
                             evolutionary process came to an end at some time in
                             the past, either abruptly or over a period.  Its
                             significant distinguishing features are, however,
                             still visible in material form.
                             
                         -   a continuing landscape is one which retains an
                             active social role in contemporary society closely
                             associated with the traditional way of life, and in
                             which the evolutionary process is still in
                             progress.  At the same time it exhibits significant
                             material evidence of its evolution over time
                             (UNESCO February 1996: 11).

<I><B>Organization of World Heritage Cities (OWHC)
</I></B>
        The <I>Organization of World Heritage Cities (OWHC) </I>was
        established in 1993 to develop a sense of solidarity and a
        cooperative relationship between <I>World Heritage </I>cites
        particularly in view of the <I>implementation </I>of the
        <I>Convention</I>.  The <I>OWHC </I>thus facilitates an
        exchange of knowledge, management techniques and financial
        resources for the purpose of protecting monuments and sites. 
        The <I>OWHC </I>is based on the idea that sites within
        populated cities endure pressures of a different nature and
        therefore may require a more dynamic style of management. 
        There are over one hundred <I>World Heritage </I>cities to
        date.

<I><B>Outstanding universal value</I></B>

        <I>Outstanding universal value </I>is referred to in several
        places in the <I>Convention </I>and the <I>Operational
        Guidelines </I>without specific definition.  Parts of the
        <I>cultural </I>and <I>natural</I> <I>heritage</I>, "because
        of their exceptional qualities, can be considered to be of
        <I>outstanding universal value</I>, and as such worthy of
        special protection against the dangers which increasingly
        threaten them" (UNESCO February 1996: 1, Paragraph 1).
        
        <I>Outstanding universal value </I>is sometimes simply
        referred to as World Heritage value.
        
        At the "Expert Meeting on Evaluation of general principles
        and criteria for nominations of natural World Heritage sites"
        held at the Parc national de la Vanoise, France on 22 to 24
        March 1996,
        
                The expert group recalled that different interpretations
                have been made of the term <I>"outstanding universal
                value" </I>which is a key to the establishment of a
                selective World Heritage List.  In a number of cases the
                term has been also interpreted as implying <I>"best of
                its kind"</I>.  The expert group stressed that the
                notion of outstanding universal value has been
                constructed over time and may be interpreted as a
                concept incorporating both uniqueness and
                representativeness (UNESCO 15 April 1996: 1).<I></I>

        The <I>World Heritage Bureau</I> and <I>Committee </I>will
        consider the substance of the report of the Expert Meeting at
        their twentieth sessions in 1996.

<I><B>Reactive monitoring</I></B>

        One of the essential functions of the <I>World Heritage
        Committee </I>is to <I>monitor </I>the <I>state of
        conservation </I>of <I>properties </I>inscribed in the
        <I>World Heritage List</I>.  The <I>Operational Guidelines
        </I>describe both <I>systematic monitoring and reporting
        </I>and <I>reactive monitoring</I>.

                <B>75.  Reactive monitoring</B> is the reporting by the
                World Heritage Centre, other sectors of UNESCO and the
                advisory bodies to the Bureau and the Committee on the
                state of conservation of specific World Heritage sites that
                are under threat. To this end, the States Parties shall
                submit to the Committee through the World Heritage Centre,
                specific reports and impact studies each time exceptional
                circumstances occur or work is undertaken which may have
                an effect on the state of conservation of the site.
                Reactive monitoring is foreseen in the procedures for the
                eventual deletion of properties from the World Heritage
                List as set out in paras. 48-56. It is also foreseen in
                reference to properties inscribed, or to be inscribed, on
                the List of World Heritage in Danger as set out in paras.

<I><B>Tentative list</I></B>

        Article 11 of the <I>Convention </I>establishes the
        requirement for <I>States Parties </I>to prepare an
        <I>inventory of property</I> (UNESCO 1972).  The
        <I>Operational Guidelines </I>refer to these <I>inventories
        </I>as <I>tentative lists</I>.
        
        Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the <I>Operational Guidelines
        </I>provide further advice to <I>States Parties </I>as to the
        definition of <I>tentative lists</I>.
        
                <B>7.</B>  The Committee requests each State Party to
                submit to it a tentative list of properties which it
                intends to nominate for inscription to the World
                Heritage List during the following five to ten years.
                This tentative list will constitute the "inventory"
                (provided for in Article 11 of the Convention) of the
                cultural and natural properties situated within the
                territory of each State Party and which it considers
                suitable for inclusion in the World Heritage List. The
                purpose of these tentative lists is to enable the
                Committee to evaluate within the widest possible context
                the "outstanding universal value" of each property
                nominated to the List. The Committee hopes that States
                Parties that have not yet submitted a tentative list
                will do so as early as possible. States Parties are
                reminded of <I>the Committee's earlier decision not to
                consider cultural nominations unless such a list of
                cultural properties has been submitted</I>.
                
                <B>8.</B>  In order to facilitate the work of all
                concerned, the Committee requests States Parties to
                submit their tentative lists in a <I>standard format</I>
                (see Annex 1) which provides for information under the
                following headings:
                
                         -       the name of the property;
                
                         -       the geographical location of the property;
                
                         -       a brief description of the property;
                
                         -       a justification of the "outstanding
                                 universal value" of the property in accordance
                                 with the criteria and conditions of
                                 authenticity or integrity set out in
                                 paragraphs 24 and 44 below, taking account of
                                 similar properties both inside and outside the
                                 boundaries of the State concerned.
                
                Natural properties should be grouped according to
                biogeographical provinces and cultural properties should
                be grouped according to cultural periods or areas. The
                <I>order</I> in which the properties listed would be
                presented for inscription should also be indicated, if
                possible (UNESCO February 1996: 3-4).
        
        As stated above the "Model for presenting a tentative list"
        is included as Annex 1 of the <I>Operational Guidelines

                these most prized possessions constitutes an
                impoverishment of the heritage of all the peoples in the
                world. Parts of that heritage, because of their
                exceptional qualities, can be considered to be of
                outstanding universal value and as such worthy of
                special protection against the dangers which
                increasingly threaten them (UNESCO February 1996: 1).

                (i)      to identify, on the basis of nominations submitted
                         by States Parties, cultural and natural properties
                         of outstanding universal value which are to be
                         protected under the Convention and to list those
                         properties on the "World Heritage List";
                     
                (ii)     monitor the state of conservation of properties
                         inscribed on the World Heritage List.
                     
                (iii)    to decide in case of urgent need which
                         properties included in the World Heritage List
                         are to be inscribed on the "List of World
                         Heritage in Danger" ((only properties which
                         require for their conservation major
                         operations and for which assistance has been
                         requested under the Convention can be
                         considered));
                     
                (iv)     to determine in what way and under what conditions
                         the resources in the World Heritage Fund can most
                         advantageously be used to assist States Parties, as
                         far as possible, in the Protection of their
                         properties of outstanding universal value (UNESCO
                         February 1996: 1).

<I><B>World Heritage emblem</I>
</B>
        The <I>World Heritage emblem</I> was designed by Mr Michel
        Olyff and adopted by the <I>Committee </I>at its second
        session in 1978.  The emblem, reproduced on the front cover
        of this Glossary, symbolizes the interdependence of cultural
        and natural properties: the central square is a form created
        by man and the circle represents nature, the two being
        intimately linked. The emblem is round, like the world, but
        at the same time it is a symbol of protection.
        
        At its eighteenth session in December 1994 the <I>World
        Heritage Committee </I>adopted the addition of text to the
        <I>World Heritage emblem</I>.  The use of the emblem with
        text is explained in Paragraph 122 of the <I>Operational
        Guidelines</I>:
        
                The emblem should always carry the text "World Heritage
                . Patrimoine Mondial".  the space occupied by
                "Patrimonio Mundial" can be used for its translation
                into the national language of the country where the logo
                is to be used (UNESCO February 1996: 41).
        
        Paragraphs 122 to 125 of the <I>Operational Guidelines
        </I>include guidance as to the appropriate use of the
        <I>World Heritage emblem </I>as adopted by the <I>Committee
        </I>(UNESCO February 1996: 41-41, Paragraphs 122-125).

<I><B>World Heritage Fund</I></B>

        The <I>World Heritage Fund </I>was established according to
        Article 15 of the <I>World Heritage Convention </I>(UNESCO
        1972).  The <I>World Heritage Fund </I>is a trust fund
        composed of contributions from a number of sources (including
        compulsory and voluntary contributions made by the <I>States
        Parties </I>to the <I>Convention</I>)<I> </I>referred to in
        Article 15 (3) of the <I>World Heritage Convention</I>.  The
        <I>Fund </I>provides the financial resources for the
        provision of <I>international assistance </I>(<I>Preparatory
        assistance</I>, <I>Emergency assistance</I>, <I>Training</I>,
        <I>Technical co-operation </I>and assistance for<I>
        promotional activities</I>).

<I><B>World Heritage List</I></B>

        Article 11 (2) of the <I>Convention </I>refers to the
        <I>World Heritage List </I>as:
        
                ... a list of properties forming part of the cultural
                heritage and natural heritage, as defined in Articles 1
                and 2 of this, as defined in Articles 1 and 2 of this
                Convention, which it considers as having outstanding
                universal value in terms of such criteria as it shall
                have established.  An updated list shall be distributed
                at least every two years (UNESCO 1972).

        The <I>World Heritage List </I>is intended to be a select
        list of <I>cultural </I>and <I>natural heritage properties
        </I>of <I>outstanding universal value </I>(UNESCO February
        1996: 2, Paragraph 6 (i).

        In accordance with Paragraph 135 of the <I>Operational
        Guidelines </I>the <I>World Heritage List </I>is published
        every year (see UNESCO-ICOMOS Documentation Centre 1996 and

        Promotion</I>.  Youth fora are convened to bring together
        Associated School's Project (ASP) students and teachers to
        share their experience of World Heritage Education (WHE), to
        catalyse the development of World Heritage curricula and to
        facilitate an exchange of information between schools in
        different countries.  Youth fora were held in Bergen, Norway
        in June 1996 and in Dubrovnik, Croatia in May 1996.  In
        September 1996 a Youth Forum will be held in Zimbabwe.

        coordinated by the <I>UNESCO World Heritage Centre </I>and
        <I>UNESCO's </I>Associated School's Project (coordinated by
        <I>UNESCO's </I>Sector for Humanistic, Cultural and
        International Education).  The project was launched in 1994
        in order to sensitize young people at secondary school level
        to the importance of <I>World Heritage</I>.  The project's
        aim is to initiate or reinforce teaching and activities in
        the area of <I>World Heritage </I>Education (WHE) and to
        produce an education kit to this end.
