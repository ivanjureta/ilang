approach and access connection,Desgin Manual,"These terms are listed under the specific access section to which they apply. The first section below is for limited access highways and uses the term approach. The second section below is for managed access highways and uses the term access connection. Approaches and access connections include any ability to leave or enter a highway right of way other than at an intersection with another road or street. (a) limited access highways: approach An access point, other than a public road/street, that allows access to or from a limited access highway on the state highway system. There are five types of approaches to limited access highways that are allowed: • Type A -- An off and on approach in a legal manner, not to exceed 30 feet in width, for the sole purpose of serving a single-family residence. It may be reserved by the abutting owner for specified use at a point satisfactory to the state at or between designated highway stations. This approach type is allowed on partial and modified control limited access highways. • Type B -- An off and on approach in a legal manner, not to exceed 50 feet in width, for use necessary to the normal operation of a farm, but not for retail marketing. It may be reserved by the abutting owner for specified use at a point satisfactory to the state at or between designated highway stations. This approach type is allowed on partial and modified control limited access highways. This approach type may be used for wind farms when use of the approach is limited to those vehicles necessary to construct and maintain the farm for use in harvesting wind energy. • Type C -- An off and on approach in a legal manner, for a special purpose and width to be agreed upon. It may be specified at a point satisfactory to the state at or between designated highway stations. This approach type is allowed on partial and modified control limited access highways and on full control limited access highways where no other reasonable means of access exists, as solely determined by the department. • Type D -- An off and on approach in a legal manner, not to exceed 50 feet in width, for use necessary to the normal operation of a commercial establishment. It may be specified at a point satisfactory to the state at or between designated highway stations. This approach type is allowed only on modified control limited access highways. • Type E -- This type is no longer allowed to be constructed because of the requirements that there be only one access point per parcel on a limited access state highway. • Type F -- An off and on approach in a legal manner, not to exceed 30 feet in width, for the sole purpose of serving a wireless communication site. It may be specified at a point satisfactory to the state at or between designated highway stations. This approach type is allowed only on partial control limited access highways. (See WAC 468-58-080(vi) for further restrictions.) (b) managed access highways: access connection An access point, other than a public road/street, that permits access to or from a managed access highway on the state highway system. There are five types of access connection permits: • conforming access connection A connection to a managed access highway that meets current WAC and WSDOT location, spacing, and design criteria. • grandfathered access connection Any connection to the state highway system that was in existence and in active use on July 1, 1990, and has not had a significant change in use.  • joint-use access connection A single connection to a managed access highway that serves two or more properties. • nonconforming access connection A connection to a managed access highway that does not meet current WSDOT location, spacing, or design criteria, pending availability of a future conforming access connection. • variance access connection A connection to a managed access highway at a location not normally allowed by current WSDOT criteria. (c) managed access connection category There are four access connection permit categories for managed access connections to state highways: Category I, Category II, Category III, and Category IV (see Design Manual Chapter 540).",,,,,,a

Erodible or leachable materials, wastes, or chemicals are substances that, when exposed to rainfall, measurably alter the physical or chemical characteristics of the rainfall runoff. Examples include erodible soils that are stockpiled, uncovered process wastes, manure, fertilizers, oily substances, ashes, kiln dust, and garbage container leakage. Metal roofs are also considered pollutiongenerating impervious surfaces unless they are coated with an inert, nonleachable material (such as a baked-on enamel coating). A surface, whether paved or not, is considered subject to vehicular use if it is regularly used by motor vehicles. The following are considered regularly used surfaces: roads, permeable pavement, unvegetated road shoulders, bicycle lanes within the travel lane of a roadway, driveways, parking lots, unfenced fire lanes, vehicular equipment storage yards, and airport runways.

It is WSDOT policy to create self-sustaining, native plant communities that require no fertilizer and little to no weed control after they are established. During the plant establishment period, usually the first three years after planting, WSDOT revegetation and mitigation projects are intensely managed to aid plant establishment. However, throughout the life of the project, WSDOT practices integrated vegetation management (IVM), which recognizes herbicides as tools in maintaining planting are as (one of many tools available).

Reasonably Foreseeable,Environment Manual,"An action is reasonably foreseeable if it is considered “likely to occur” and isn’t too “speculative.” EPA’s Consideration of Cumulative Impacts in EPA Review of NEPA Documents (May, 1999) states that “Court decisions . . . have generally concluded that reasonably foreseeable future actions need to be considered even if they are not specific proposals. The criterion for excluding future actions is whether they are “speculative.” The NEPA document should include discussion of future actions to be taken by the action agency. The analysis should also incorporate information based on the planning documents of other federal agencies, and state and local governments. For example, projects included in a 5-year budget cycle might be considered likely to occur while those only occurring in 10-25 year strategic planning would be less likely and perhaps even speculative.” Language from court decisions can be helpful in formulating questions and criteria as practitioners proceed with analysis to determine which actions may be reasonably foreseeable. For example, one court case defined “reasonably foreseeable” as an action that is “sufficiently likely to occur, that a person of ordinary prudence would take it into account in making a decision.” Sierra Club v. Marsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st Cir. 1992) (Sierra Club IV). Courts have also recognized that “An environmental impact is considered ‘too speculative’ for inclusion in an EIS (Environmental Impact Statement) if it cannot be described at the time the EIS is drafted with sufficient specificity to make its consideration useful to a reasonable decision maker.” Dubois v. US. Dept. of Agriculture, 102 F.3d 1273,1286 (1st Cir. 1996). Factors that indicate whether an action or project is “reasonably foreseeable” for the purposes of cumulative impacts analysis include: whether the project has been federally approved; whether there is funding pending before any agency for the project; and whether there is evidence of active preparation to make a decision on alternatives to the project. Clairton Sportmen’s Club v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, 882 F. Supp 455 (W.D. Pa 1995).",,,,,,R

soil drainage,Highway Runoff Manual,"As a natural condition of the soil, the frequency and duration of periods when the soil is free of saturation. In well-drained soils, the water is removed readily, but not rapidly; in poorly drained soils, the root zone is waterlogged for long periods unless artificially drained, and the roots of ordinary crop plants cannot get enough oxygen; and in excessively drained soils, the water is removed so completely that most crop plants suffer from lack of water. Strictly speaking, excessively drained soils are a result of excessive runoff due to steep slopes or low available water-holding capacity due to small amounts of silt and clay in the soil material. The following classes are used to express soil drainage: § Well drained – Excess water drains away rapidly; no mottling occurs within 36 inches of the surface. § Moderately well drained – Water is removed from the soil somewhat slowly, resulting in small but significant periods of wetness; mottling occurs between 18 and 36 inches. § Somewhat poorly drained – Water is removed from the soil slowly enough to keep it wet for significant periods but not all the time; mottling occurs between 8 and 18 inches. § Poorly drained – Water is removed so slowly that the soil is wet for a large part of the time; mottling occurs between 0 and 8 inches. § Very poorly drained – Water is removed so slowly that the water table remains at or near the surface for a greater part of the time. There may also be periods of surface ponding. The soil has a black-to-gray surface layer with mottles up to the surface",,,,,,s

Sufficient Property Rights,Right of Way Manual,"Per 23 CFR 1.23 and 710.201(e), the real property interest acquired for federal aid projects by the acquiring agency must be adequate for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the resulting facility and for the protection of both the facility and the traveling public. For instance, if there is a highway embankment, the acquiring agency must acquire permanent property rights for the slope area, since the slope area is integral to the structural integrity of the roadbed. The acquiring agency must acquire any property needed for mitigation and any staging areas required by the NEPA document in the certification. This also means R/W shown as needed on the PS&E, not just the R/W plan, needs to be certified. For property that is not permanently needed for the project, but is necessary for construction of the project, temporary construction easements, leases, license agreements, permits, and/or rights of entry may be appropriate. See Right of Way Manual Chapter 6 for appropriate use of these instruments. WSDOT normally acquires fee simple title for R/W and limited access. This policy should be considered by local agencies. There are instances where something less than full fee acquisition is sufficient, such as when the property is owned by the federal or state government, railroads, and Indian Nations or if it is only needed to construct the project (e.g., temporary construction easements or driveway reconnect permits).",,,,,,S
