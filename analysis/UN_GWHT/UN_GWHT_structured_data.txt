Cultural landscapes represent the "combined\n                works of nature and of man" designated in Article 1 of\n                the Convention.  They are illustrative of the evolution\n                of human society and settlement over time, under the\n                influence of the physical constraints and/or\n                opportunities presented by their natural environment and\n                of successive social, economic and cultural forces, both\n                external and internal.  They should be selected on the\n                basis both of their outstanding universal value and of\n                their representativity in terms of a clearly defined\n                geo-cultural region and also for their capacity to\n                illustrate the essential and distinct cultural elements\n                of such regions.\n                \n                37.  The term "cultural landscape" embraces a\n                diversity of manifestations of the interaction between\n                humankind and its natural environment.\n                \n                38.  Cultural landscapes often reflect\n                specific techniques of sustainable land-use, considering\n                the characteristics and limits of the natural\n                environment they are established in, and a specific\n                spiritual relation to nature.  Protection of cultural\n                landscapes can contribute to modern techniques of\n                sustainable land-use and can maintain or enhance natural\n                values in the landscape.  The continued existence of\n                traditional forms of land-use supports biological\n                diversity in many regions of the world.

Parts of the\n        cultural and natural heritage, "because\n        of their exceptional qualities, can be considered to be of\n        outstanding universal value, and as such worthy of\n        special protection against the dangers which increasingly\n        threaten them" (UNESCO February 1996: 1, Paragraph 1).\n        \n        Outstanding universal value is sometimes simply\n        referred to as World Heritage value.\n        \n        At the "Expert Meeting on Evaluation of general principles\n        and criteria for nominations of natural World Heritage sites"\n        held at the Parc national de la Vanoise, France on 22 to 24\n        March 1996,\n        \n                The expert group recalled that different interpretations\n                have been made of the term "outstanding universal\n                value" which is a key to the establishment of a\n                selective World Heritage List.  In a number of cases the\n                term has been also interpreted as implying "best of\n                its kind".  The expert group stressed that the\n                notion of outstanding universal value has been\n                constructed over time and may be interpreted as a\n                concept incorporating both uniqueness and\n                representativeness (UNESCO 15 April 1996: 1).\n\n        The World Heritage Bureau and Committee will\n        consider the substance of the report of the Expert Meeting at\n        their twentieth sessions in 1996.', 'Outstanding universal value')}}, 'n_307': {'uid': 'n_307', 'nickname': 'OWHC', 'full_name': 'OWHC', 'instance_of': 'Definiendum', 'relationships': {('Definiendum', 'Short Definiendum'): ('OWHC', 'OWHC'), ('Definiendum', 'Definiens'): ('OWHC', 'see Organization of World Heritage Cities')}}, 'n_308': {'uid': 'n_308', 'nickname': 'OWHC', 'full_name': 'OWHC', 'instance_of': 'Short Definiendum', 'relationships': {('Short Definiendum', 'Definiendum'): ('OWHC', 'OWHC'), ('Short Definiendum', 'Definiens'): ('OWHC', 'see Organization of World Heritage Cities')}}, 'n_309': {'uid': 'n_309', 'nickname': 'see Organizatio...', 'full_name': 'see Organization of World Heritage Cities', 'instance_of': 'Definiens', 'relationships': {('Definiens', 'Definiendum'): ('see Organization of World Heritage Cities', 'OWHC'), ('Definiens', 'Short Definiendum'): ('see Organization of World Heritage Cities', 'OWHC')}}, 'n_310': {'uid': 'n_310', 'nickname': 'Precisely delin...', 'full_name': 'Precisely delineated [natural] areas', 'instance_of': 'Definiendum', 'relationships': {('Definiendum', 'Short Definiendum'): ('Precisely delineated [natural] areas', 'Precisely delineated [natural] areas'), ('Definiendum', 'Definiens'): ('Precisely delineated [natural] areas', 'Precisely delineated [natural] areas are\n        referred to as part of the definition of natural heritage\n        in Article 2 of the Convention (UNESCO 1972).\n        \nsee Natural heritage')}}, 'n_311': {'uid': 'n_311', 'nickname': 'Precisely delin...', 'full_name': 'Precisely delineated [natural] areas', 'instance_of': 'Short Definiendum', 'relationships': {('Short Definiendum', 'Definiendum'): ('Precisely delineated [natural] areas', 'Precisely delineated [natural] areas'), ('Short Definiendum', 'Definiens'): ('Precisely delineated [natural] areas', 'Precisely delineated [natural] areas are\n        referred to as part of the definition of natural heritage\n        in Article 2 of the Convention (UNESCO 1972).\n        \nsee Natural heritage')}}, 'n_312': {'uid': 'n_312', 'nickname': 'Precisely delin...', 'full_name': 'Precisely delineated [natural] areas are\n        referred to as part of the definition of natural heritage\n        in Article 2 of the Convention (UNESCO 1972).\n        \nsee Natural heritage', 'instance_of': 'Definiens', 'relationships': {('Definiens', 'Definiendum'): ('Precisely delineated [natural] areas are\n        referred to as part of the definition of natural heritage\n        in Article 2 of the Convention (UNESCO 1972).\n        \nsee Natural heritage', 'Precisely delineated [natural] areas'), ('Definiens', 'Short Definiendum'): ('Precisely delineated [natural] areas are\n        referred to as part of the definition of natural heritage\n        in Article 2 of the Convention (UNESCO 1972).\n        \nsee Natural heritage', 'Precisely delineated [natural] areas')}}, 'n_313': {'uid': 'n_313', 'nickname': 'Preparatory ass...', 'full_name': 'Preparatory assistance', 'instance_of': 'Definiendum', 'relationships': {('Definiendum', 'Short Definiendum'): ('Preparatory assistance', 'Preparatory assistance'), ('Definiendum', 'Definiens'): ('Preparatory assistance', 'Preparatory assistance is one of the types of\n        international assistance available to States\n        Parties from the World Heritage Fund.
