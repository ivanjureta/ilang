Cultural landscapes represent the "combined\n                works of nature and of man" designated in Article 1 of\n                the Convention.  They are illustrative of the evolution\n                of human society and settlement over time, under the\n                influence of the physical constraints and/or\n                opportunities presented by their natural environment and\n                of successive social, economic and cultural forces, both\n                external and internal.  They should be selected on the\n                basis both of their outstanding universal value and of\n                their representativity in terms of a clearly defined\n                geo-cultural region and also for their capacity to\n                illustrate the essential and distinct cultural elements\n                of such regions.\n                \n                37.

Cultural landscapes often reflect\n                specific techniques of sustainable land-use, considering\n                the characteristics and limits of the natural\n                environment they are established in, and a specific\n                spiritual relation to nature.  Protection of cultural\n                landscapes can contribute to modern techniques of\n                sustainable land-use and can maintain or enhance natural\n                values in the landscape.  The continued existence of\n                traditional forms of land-use supports biological\n                diversity in many regions of the world.  The protection\n                of traditional cultural landscapes is therefore helpful\n                in maintaining biological diversity (UNESCO February\n                1996: 10-11).\n
