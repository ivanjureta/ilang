        was prepared by the UNESCO ""Expert Meeting on
        Cultural Landscapes of Outstanding Universal Value"" held in
        Templin, Germany in October 1993 (see von Droste et al
        1995: Annex 1).  The Action Plan outlines
        recommendations concerning the provision of ""Guidance to
        States Parties on the Identification, Assessment, Nomination
        and Management of Cultural Landscapes for Inclusion in the
        World Heritage List"" and on the preparation of a ""Thematic
        Study on Cultural Landscapes"".  The Action Plan was
        adopted by the World Heritage Committee at its
        seventeenth session in 1993 (UNESCO 4 February 1994:
        55-56 and Annex VII).

Associative cultural landscape,Associative cultural landscape,"Associative cultural landscape is one of the
        three main categories of cultural landscapes adopted
        by the World Heritage Committee at its sixteenth
        session in December 1992 (UNESCO 14 December 1992: 54-55) and
        included in the Operational Guidelines (UNESCO
        February 1996: 11, Paragraph 39).
        
        Paragraph 39 (iii) of the Operational Guidelines
        refers to associative cultural landscapes in the
        following way:
                
                39.
                
                (iii) The final category is the associative cultural
                      landscape.  The inclusion of such landscapes on 
                      the World Heritage List is justifiable by virtue 
                      of the powerful religious, artistic or cultural 
                      associations of the natural element rather than 
                      material cultural evidence, which may be insignificant 
                      or even absent(UNESCO February 1996: 11, Paragraph 39).

        Tongariro National Park in New Zealand and Uluru-Kata
        Tjuta National Park in Australia were included in the
        World Heritage List as associative cultural
        landscapes in 1993 and 1994 respectively (UNESCO 4
        February 1994: 39 and UNESCO 31 January 1995: 52).

        In April 1995 Australia ICOMOS held an ""Asia-Pacific Regional

Authenticity,Authenticity,"Paragraph 24 of the Operational Guidelines requires
        that a cultural property nominated for inclusion in
        the World Heritage List be considered for inclusion
        only if it meets one or more of the cultural heritage
        criteria and the test of authenticity.
        
        Paragraph 24 (b) (i) of the Operational Guidelines as
        reproduced below refers to the test of

                           distinctive character and components (the 
                           Committee stressed the reconstruction is only
                           acceptable if it is carried out on the basis

        The text concerning groups of urban buildings included
        in the Operational Guidelines also refers to the need
        to meet the test of authenticity (UNESCO February
        1996: 8, Paragraph 27).
        
        Paragraphs 57 and 58 of the Operational Guidelines
        state that cultural properties nominated for
        inclusion in the World Heritage List should satisfy
        the conditions of authenticity and that the
        determination as to whether these conditions are met will be
        carried out by ICOMOS (UNESCO February 1996: 18).
        
        Paragraph 64 (e) of the Operational Guidelines states
        that ""indications as to the authenticity of the property""
        should be included in the completed nomination form
        under the heading of ""Justification for inclusion in the
        World Heritage List"" (UNESCO February 1996: 20).
        
        Paragraphs 64 (f) (iv) and 78 of the Operational
        Guidelines refer to the undefined concept of ""historical
        authenticity"" (UNESCO February 1996: 20 and 28).
        
        It is generally acknowledged that the concept of
        authenticity is a vague one and may be subject to
        different cultural and social interpretations. 
        Authenticity and its application in relation to the
        World Heritage Convention was the subject of a
        conference held in Nara, Japan in November 1994 (Nara
        Conference on Authenticity in Relation to the World Heritage
        Convention).  A preparatory workshop was held in Bergen
        in Norway from 31 January to 2 February 1994.  The
        proceedings of the preliminary workshop are published in
        Larson and Marstein (1994).  The Nara Conference
        resulted in the adoption of a declaration known as The
        Nara Document on Authenticity.  The proceedings of the
        Nara Conference and the Nara Document on
        Authenticity are published in Larson (1995).
        
        In March 1996 an Inter-American Symposium on Authenticity in
        the Conservation and Management of Cultural Heritage was held
        in San Antonio Texas, U.S.A.  The Symposium was co-sponsored
        by US/ICOMOS, the Getty Cosnervation Institute and the San
        Antonio Conservation Society.

Balance,Balance,"Balance is first referred to in Paragraph 6(iii) of
        the Operational Guidelines with reference to efforts
        to maintain a ""reasonable balance between the numbers of
        cultural heritage and the natural heritage properties""
        included in the World Heritage List.  This statement
        is reaffirmed in Paragraph 15 of the Operational
        Guidelines (UNESCO February 1996: 2, 3 and 5) and is in
        conformity with the spirit of the Convention as an
        instrument for the conservation of both the natural and the
        cultural heritage.
        
        In the section of the Operational Guidelines concerned
        with the granting of international assistance,
        Paragraph 111 states that a ""balance will be maintained
        between funds allocated to projects for the preservation of
        the cultural heritage on the one hand and projects for the
        conservation of the natural heritage on the other hand""
        (UNESCO February 1996: 38).
        
        Section VI of the Operational Guidelines is entitled
        ""Balance between the Cultural and the Natural Heritage in the
        Implementation of the Convention"" (UNESCO February 1996: 40-
        41).  Paragraph 121 outlines a number of measures recommended
        by the Committee to achieve this balance
        (UNESCO February 1996: 40-41).
        
        The balance between the numbers of natural and
        cultural properties inscribed in the World
        Heritage List was the subject of discussion at the March
        1996 ""Expert Meeting on Evaluation of general principles and
        criteria for nominations of natural World Heritage sites""
        (UNESCO 15 April 1996).  The report of the Expert Meeting
        notes that """"balance"" is not about numbers, but about
        representativity for biogeographical regions or events in the
        history of life"" (UNESCO 15 April 1996: 6).  The World
        Heritage Bureau and Committee will consider the substance of
        the report of the Expert Meeting at their twentieth sessions
        in 1996."

        nomination to the World Heritage List
        (Paragraph 19(iii)) and for IUCN when preparing

                restrictions placed on its use to give an added layer of
                protection; the area constituting the buffer zone should
                be determined in each case through technical studies
                (UNESCO February 1996: 5).
        
        Paragraph 17 of the Operational Guidelines further
        states that:

                cultural or natural property nominated, an adequate
                ""buffer zone"" around a property should be provided and

                shall be considered as ""cultural heritage"":
                         
                monuments: architectural works, works of monumental
                sculpture and painting, elements or structures of
                an archaeological nature, inscriptions, cave
                dwellings and combinations of features, which are
                of outstanding universal value from the point of
                view of history, art or science;
                groups of buildings: groups of separate or
                connected buildings which, because of their
                architecture, their homogeneity or their place in
                the landscape, are of outstanding universal value
                from the point of view of history, art or science;
                sites: works of man or the combined works of nature
                and man, and areas including archaeological sites
                which are of outstanding universal value from the
                historical, aesthetic, ethnological or
                anthropological point of view (UNESCO 1972)."

Cultural landscapes,Cultural landscapes,"At its sixteenth session in December 1992 the World
        Heritage Committee adopted three main categories of
        cultural landscapes (UNESCO 14 December 1992: 54-55)
        and included guidelines concerning their inclusion in the
        World Heritage List in the Operational
        Guidelines (UNESCO February 1996: 10-12, Paragraphs 35 to
        42).
        Paragraphs 36 to 38 of the Operational Guidelines
        provide some definition of cultural landscapes.
        
                36.  Cultural landscapes represent the ""combined
                works of nature and of man"" designated in Article 1 of
                the Convention.  They are illustrative of the evolution
                of human society and settlement over time, under the
                influence of the physical constraints and/or
                opportunities presented by their natural environment and
                of successive social, economic and cultural forces, both
                external and internal.  They should be selected on the
                basis both of their outstanding universal value and of
                their representativity in terms of a clearly defined
                geo-cultural region and also for their capacity to
                illustrate the essential and distinct cultural elements
                of such regions.
                
                37.  The term ""cultural landscape"" embraces a
                diversity of manifestations of the interaction between
                humankind and its natural environment.
                
                38.  Cultural landscapes often reflect
                specific techniques of sustainable land-use, considering
                the characteristics and limits of the natural
                environment they are established in, and a specific
                spiritual relation to nature.  Protection of cultural
                landscapes can contribute to modern techniques of
                sustainable land-use and can maintain or enhance natural
                values in the landscape.  The continued existence of
                traditional forms of land-use supports biological
                diversity in many regions of the world.  The protection
                of traditional cultural landscapes is therefore helpful
                in maintaining biological diversity (UNESCO February
                1996: 10-11).
                
        Paragraph 39 of the Operational Guidelines refers to
        cultural landscapes as falling into three main
        categories - the clearly defined landscape, the
        organically evolved landscape (including relict (or
        fossil) landscapes and continuing landscapes) and
        associative cultural landscapes (UNESCO February 1996:
        11).
        
        Paragraphs 40 to 42 of the Operational Guidelines
        provide some further guidance concerning the inclusion of
        cultural landscapes in the World Heritage List
        (UNESCO February 1996: 11-12).

        Since 1992 several regional and thematic meetings on the
        subject of cultural landscapes of outstanding
        universal value have been held (see for example, von
        Droste et al 1995, von Droste et al 1995:
        Annexes II to VI and UNESCO 21 April 1996).

        extent that it has lost those characteristics which
        determined its inclusion in the World Heritage List
        (UNESCO February 1996: 31, Paragraph 89).

                The evaluation of whether or not individual sites
                nominated by States Parties satisfy the criteria and the
                conditions of authenticity/integrity will be carried out

                category of 'cultural landscapes', as appropriate, the
                evaluation will be carried out in consultation with the

Global Strategy,Global Strategy,"The Global Strategy is a conceptual framework devised
        to ensure the representativeness and credibility of the
        World Heritage List.  The Global Strategy was
        adopted by the World Heritage Committee at its
        eighteenth session in 1994 (UNESCO 13 October 1994). 
        
        The Global Strategy was originally devised with
        particular reference to cultural heritage.  In March
        1996 a group of experts meeting in the Parc National de la
        Vanoise, France, affirmed the application of the Global
        Strategy for natural heritage (UNESCO 15 April
        1996). The World Heritage Bureau and Committee will consider
        the substance of the report of the group of experts at their
        twentieth sessions in 1996.

        The regional and thematic meetings held on the subject of
        cultural landscapes of outstanding universal value
        (see for example, von Droste et al 1995, von
        Droste et al 1995: Annexes 11 to VI and UNESCO 21
        April 1996) and meetings on authenticity (Larson and
        Marstein 1994, Larson 1995 and Inter-American Symposium on
        Authenticity, March 1996) are all important contributions to
        the aims of the Global Strategy.

Integrity,Integrity,"Also known as Conditions of integrity.
        
        The concept of integrity is not referred to directly
        in the World Heritage Convention.
        
        Paragraph 44 of the Operational Guidelines requires
        that a natural property nominated for inclusion in the
        World Heritage List be considered for inclusion only
        if it meets one or more of the natural heritage criteria
        and fulfils the conditions of integrity
        (UNESCO February 1996: 12).  This requirement is again
        referred to in Paragraph 45 of the Operational
        Guidelines (UNESCO February 1996: 15).
        
        The conditions of integrity may be summarised from
        Paragraph 44 (b) (i) to (iv) of the Operational
        Guidelines as follows:
                44.
                ...
                         (b) ...
                         
                         (i)     The sites described in 44(a)(i) should contain
                                 all or most of the key interrelated and
                                 interdependent elements in their natural
                                 relationships ...
                               
                         (ii)    The sites described in 44(a)(ii) should have
                                 sufficient size and contain the necessary
                                 elements to demonstrate the key aspects of
                                 processes that are essential for the long-term
                                 conservation of the ecosystems and the
                                 biological diversity they contain ...
                               
                         (iii)   The sites described in 44(a)(iii) should
                                 be of outstanding aesthetic value and
                                 include areas that are essential for
                                 maintaining the beauty of the site ...
                               
                         (iv)    The sites described in paragraph 44(a)(iv)
                                 should contain habitats for maintaining the
                                 most diverse fauna and flora characteristic of
                                 the biogeographic province and ecosystems
                                 under consideration ... 
                                 (UNESCO February 1996: 13-14).
        
        Paragraphs 57 and 58 of the Operational Guidelines
        state that natural properties nominated for
        inclusion in the World Heritage List should satisfy
        the conditions of integrity and that the determination
        as to whether these conditions are met will be carried out by
        IUCN  (UNESCO February 1996: 18).  Furthermore,
        Paragraph 58 (d) of the Operational Guidelines also
        requests that IUCN in examining and evaluating
        nominations, ""make comments and recommendations on the
        integrity and future management of each property recommended
        by the Bureau, during its presentation to the Committee""
        (UNESCO February 1996: 19).
        
        The Operational Guidelines refer to the threat to the
        integrity of natural properties as one of the
        criterion for the inclusion of natural properties
        in the List of World Heritage in Danger (UNESCO
        February 1996: 29, Paragraph 79 (i) (c)).  Paragraph 80 of
        the Operational Guidelines makes comments concerning
        how threats to the integrity of natural properties
        may be ""amenable to correction by human action"" or by
        ""administrative or legislative action, such as the cancelling
        of a major public works project or the improvement of legal
        status"" (UNESCO February 1996: 29).
        
        On only one occasion the concept of integrity is
        referred to with reference to the conservation of
        cultural properties.  In Paragraph 24 (b)(ii) of the
        Operational Guidelines reference is made to the need
        to ""preserve the integrity of cultural sites"" (UNESCO
        February 1996: 8).
        
        The possibility of applying conditions of integrity to
        both natural heritage and cultural heritage,
        ""and thus of applying one common approach for the
        identification and evaluation of World Heritage"" was the
        subject of discussion at the March 1996 ""Expert Meeting on
        Evaluation of general principles and criteria for nominations
        of natural World Heritage sites"" (UNESCO 15 April 1996).  The
        World Heritage Bureau and Committee will
        consider the substance of the report of the Expert Meeting at
        their twentieth sessions in 1996."

        World Heritage Convention, known also as the
        Operational Guidelines or simply as the
        Guidelines, were prepared by the World Heritage
        Committee for the purpose of informing States
        Parties to the Convention of the principles which
        guide the work of the World Heritage Committee in
        establishing the World Heritage List, the List of
        World Heritage in Danger and in granting international
        assistance under the World Heritage Fund (see
        UNESCO February 1996: 1-2, Paragraph 4).  The Operational
        Guidelines provide guidance concerning the format and
        content of nominations to the World Heritage List
        and present the timetable for submission and
        evaluation of the nominations.  The
        Operational Guidelines also provide details on other
        questions, mainly of a procedural nature, which relate to the
        implementation of the Convention.  Most
        importantly the Operational Guidelines present the
        ""Criteria for the inclusion of cultural properties in the
        World Heritage List"" and the ""Criteria for the inclusion of
        natural properties in the World Heritage List"".
        
        The Operational Guidelines have been prepared with the
        intention of ensuring objective and scientific decision-
        making on the part of the World Heritage Committee.
        
        The first version of the Operational Guidelines were
        adopted by the World Heritage Committee in 1977. 
        Since 1977 the Operational Guidelines have been
        adjusted and expanded to reflect the subsequent decisions of
        the Committee.  Nine major revisions of the
        Operational Guidelines had been produced and adopted
        by the World Heritage Committee up until June 1996."
Organically evolved landscape,Organically evolved landscape,"Organically evolved landscape is one of the three main
        categories of cultural landscapes adopted by the
        World Heritage Committee at its sixteenth session in
        December 1992 (UNESCO 14 December 1992: 54-55) and included
        in the Operational Guidelines (UNESCO February 1996:
        11, Paragraph 39).
        
        Paragraph 39 (ii) of the Operational Guidelines refers
        to organically evolved landscapes in the following
        way:
        
                39.

                (i)      The second category is the organically evolved
                         landscape.  This results from an initial social,
                         economic, administrative, and/or religious imperative
                         and has developed its present form by association
                         with and in response to its natural environment. 
                         Such landscapes reflect that process of evolution in
                         their form and component features.  They fall into
                         two sub-categories:
                
                         -   a relict (or fossil) landscape is one in which an
                             evolutionary process came to an end at some time in
                             the past, either abruptly or over a period.  Its
                             significant distinguishing features are, however,
                             still visible in material form.
                             
                         -   a continuing landscape is one which retains an
                             active social role in contemporary society closely
                             associated with the traditional way of life, and in
                             which the evolutionary process is still in
                             progress.  At the same time it exhibits significant
                             material evidence of its evolution over time
                             (UNESCO February 1996: 11).

Organization of World Heritage Cities,OWHC,"The Organization of World Heritage Cities (OWHC) was
        established in 1993 to develop a sense of solidarity and a
        cooperative relationship between World Heritage cites
        particularly in view of the implementation of the
        Convention.  The OWHC thus facilitates an
        exchange of knowledge, management techniques and financial
        resources for the purpose of protecting monuments and sites. 
        The OWHC is based on the idea that sites within
        populated cities endure pressures of a different nature and
        therefore may require a more dynamic style of management. 
        There are over one hundred World Heritage cities to
        date.

Outstanding universal value,Outstanding universal value,"Outstanding universal value is referred to in several
        places in the Convention and the Operational
        Guidelines without specific definition.  Parts of the
        cultural and natural heritage, ""because
        of their exceptional qualities, can be considered to be of
        outstanding universal value, and as such worthy of
        special protection against the dangers which increasingly
        threaten them"" (UNESCO February 1996: 1, Paragraph 1).
        
        Outstanding universal value is sometimes simply
        referred to as World Heritage value.
        
        At the ""Expert Meeting on Evaluation of general principles
        and criteria for nominations of natural World Heritage sites""
        held at the Parc national de la Vanoise, France on 22 to 24
        March 1996,
        
                The expert group recalled that different interpretations
                have been made of the term ""outstanding universal
                value"" which is a key to the establishment of a
                selective World Heritage List.  In a number of cases the
                term has been also interpreted as implying ""best of
                its kind"".  The expert group stressed that the
                notion of outstanding universal value has been
                constructed over time and may be interpreted as a
                concept incorporating both uniqueness and
                representativeness (UNESCO 15 April 1996: 1).

        conservation of properties inscribed in the
        World Heritage List.  The Operational Guidelines
        describe systematic monitoring and reporting and
        reactive monitoring.

                69.  Systematic monitoring and
                reporting is the continuous process of observing the
                conditions of World Heritage sites with periodic
                reporting on its state of conservation (UNESCO February
                1996: 26, Paragraph 69).

        Guidance concerning the objectives, process and importance of
        systematic monitoring and reporting is included in
        Paragraphs 69 to 74 of the Operational Guidelines
        (UNESCO February 1996: 26-27).

Tentative list,Tentative list,"Article 11 of the Convention establishes the
        requirement for States Parties to prepare an
        inventory of property (UNESCO 1972).  The
        Operational Guidelines refer to these inventories
        as tentative lists.
        
        Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Operational Guidelines
        provide further advice to States Parties as to the
        definition of tentative lists.
        
                7.  The Committee requests each State Party to
                submit to it a tentative list of properties which it
                intends to nominate for inscription to the World
                Heritage List during the following five to ten years.
                This tentative list will constitute the ""inventory""
                (provided for in Article 11 of the Convention) of the
                cultural and natural properties situated within the
                territory of each State Party and which it considers
                suitable for inclusion in the World Heritage List. The
                purpose of these tentative lists is to enable the
                Committee to evaluate within the widest possible context
                the ""outstanding universal value"" of each property
                nominated to the List. The Committee hopes that States
                Parties that have not yet submitted a tentative list
                will do so as early as possible. States Parties are
                reminded of the Committee's earlier decision not to
                consider cultural nominations unless such a list of
                cultural properties has been submitted.
                
                8.  In order to facilitate the work of all
                concerned, the Committee requests States Parties to
                submit their tentative lists in a standard format
                (see Annex 1) which provides for information under the
                following headings:
                
                         -       the name of the property;

                         -       a brief description of the property;
                
                         -       a justification of the ""outstanding
                                 universal value"" of the property in accordance
                                 with the criteria and conditions of

                                 boundaries of the State concerned.
                
                Natural properties should be grouped according to
                biogeographical provinces and cultural properties should
                be grouped according to cultural periods or areas. The
                order in which the properties listed would be
                presented for inscription should also be indicated, if
                possible (UNESCO February 1996: 3-4).
